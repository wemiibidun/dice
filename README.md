## Dice Game
This project was done to practice DOM. With DOM, you have the ability to create, build and navigate through the structure of a webpage. You can also add, modify, or delete elements and contents in a webpage.

## Status
Project is: _Complete_


## Inspiration
This project was created with the support of [Web Development Bootcamp Course by Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/lecture/17038694?start=150#overview)


## Summary
In this project, I improved on my HTML 5, CSS3 and learnt more about DOM in Javascript. DOM is an application programming interface (API) for manipulating HTML and XML documents. It represents a document as a tree of nodes. It provides API that allows you to add, remove, and modify parts of the document effectively.
