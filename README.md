## Summary

In this project, I improved on my HTML 5, CSS3 and learnt more about DOM in Javascript. DOM is an application programming interface (API) for manipulating HTML and XML documents. It represents a document as a tree of nodes. It provides API that allows you to add, remove, and modify parts of the document effectively.
